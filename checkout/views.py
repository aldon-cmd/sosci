class PaymentDetailsView(views.PaymentDetailsView,mixins.BasketMixin,catalogue_mixins.EnrollmentMixin):
    """
    For taking the details of payment and creating the order.

    This view class is used by two separate URLs: 'payment-details' and
    'preview'. The `preview` class attribute is used to distinguish which is
    being used. Chronologically, `payment-details` (preview=False) comes before
    `preview` (preview=True).

    If sensitive details are required (eg a bankcard), then the payment details
    view should submit to the preview URL and a custom implementation of
    `validate_payment_submission` should be provided.

    - If the form data is valid, then the preview template can be rendered with
      the payment-details forms re-rendered within a hidden div so they can be
      re-submitted when the 'place order' button is clicked. This avoids having
      to write sensitive data to disk anywhere during the process. This can be
      done by calling `render_preview`, passing in the extra template context
      vars.

    - If the form data is invalid, then the payment details templates needs to
      be re-rendered with the relevant error messages. This can be done by
      calling `render_payment_details`, passing in the form instances to pass
      to the templates.

    The class is deliberately split into fine-grained methods, responsible for
    only one thing.  This is to make it easier to subclass and override just
    one component of functionality.

    All projects will need to subclass and customise this class as no payment
    is taken by default.
